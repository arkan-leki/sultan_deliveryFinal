    <p>If you’re leaving your computer for a short time, you should lock your
        screen to prevent other people from accessing your files or running
        applications. When you return, you will see the
        <link xref="shell-lockscreen">lock screen</link>. Enter your
        password to log back in. If you don’t lock your screen, it will lock
        automatically after a certain amount of time.
    </p>

    <p>To lock your screen, click the system menu on the right side of the top
        bar and select <gui>Lock</gui> from the menu.
    </p>

    <p>When your screen is locked, other users can log in to their own accounts
        by clicking <gui>Log in as another user</gui> at the bottom right of the login
        screen. You can switch back to your desktop when they are finished.
